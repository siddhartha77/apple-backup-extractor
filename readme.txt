Apple Backup Extractor

Drop an Apple Backup disk file onto the icon. All files in the same directory will be extracted if they are verified to be of the same backup as the dropped file. Incomplete backups are supported. This application will try to recreate the directory tree of all files and extract as much data as it can. Any partial files will be created and will have a ".part" suffix.

Portions of code were based on DropShell 2.0 by Leonard Rosenthol, Marshall Clow, and Stephan Somogyi; and the BSNG 2.6 SDK by Buck Rogers.
